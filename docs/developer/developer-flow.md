# Developer Workflow Cycle

At CivicTechJobs, development work follows a predictable pipeline. Work typically begins with a stable\* design for a webpage. This design is then dissected into components and smaller issues for frontend developers to work on. During this time, other issues might pop up, such as the need for more automations or refactoring of the codebase due to new developments. 

> ###### *\*Note: Stable here means that the design has been approved by the team to meet MVP requirements and is unlikely to change in the near future. Stable designs are usually located in the bottom right corner of our Figma surrounded by a pink rectangle.*
