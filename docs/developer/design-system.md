## Components

Why components over css sheets? (because components can be edited once, and standardizes components; very useful when designing for accessibility)

### Layout and Columns

> "Using layout and column utilities automantically adds scalability to your pages." 

### Smart Spacing

> "99% of the time, as screens shrinks, you want to reclaim space from paddings and margins."

### Responsive Mixins

> "When using responsive mixins, order matters! Always declare them from big to small."
