# CivicTechJobs-Documentation
## Description:

CivicTechJobs-Documentation (CTJ-D) is the MKDocs version of the [CivicTechJobs wiki](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/wiki). It is unaffiliated with CivicTechJobs and HackForLA. CTJ-D was started as a tryout for MKDocs, which turns out, is pretty easy to set up and great to use! This project is mainly for my personal use, and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date with [CivicTechJob's official wiki](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/wiki).
